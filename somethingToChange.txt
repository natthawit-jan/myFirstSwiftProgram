I want my codes to be as elegent as the one I used to see in the late 90s. Boys and girls dressed in the fancy design. They didn't care for the ways 
people looked at them. They just wanted to be fabulious. I want our app to include a feature where people can match their style with the 90s 
and give them the similarility percentage.


I also want it to look elegant. Thanks for your suggestion.
